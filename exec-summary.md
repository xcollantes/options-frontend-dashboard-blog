This document describes the purpose of a tool for proactively finding stock
opportunities, with a focus on [Fundamental
Analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp#:~:text=Fundamental%20analysis%20is%20a%20valuation,in%20and%20its%20financial%20performance).

## Problem

How do most people today choose a stock as a good investment?

- Through hearing a popular stock and investing in it
- If knowledge is within reach, performing analysis on a 10-K
- News about the company including Earnings Calls results

Most people today choose stocks to invest in based on word-of-mouth, news
articles, or their own analysis of financial statements. However, there are too
many stocks to analyze manually, and it can be difficult to identify good
investment opportunities at scale.

## Goal

Narrow down to one to three alternatives for a good investment.

This tool will use technology to analyze stocks at scale and identify potential
investment opportunities. The tool will use a variety of factors, including
Fundamental Analysis, to assess the profitability of a stock.

## Analysis and algorithms

How I will analyze stocks.

No magic formula exists to find a good stock to invest in. I will aim then to
give myself the best chances given available information.

Features are based on philosophical heuristics and research found in my research
which may or may not be published in this web application.

## Non-goals

What this project is not. The aim of the project including the research,
tools, and process is:

- not to assist in Day Trading
- not to empower decisions in cryptocurrency since forces that move
  cryptocurrency is far different than stocks (more detail in future publications
- not to take advantage of [Technical
  Analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp) but
  instead focus on [Fundamental Analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp).
